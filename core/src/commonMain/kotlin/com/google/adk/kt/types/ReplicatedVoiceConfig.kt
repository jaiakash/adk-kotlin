 * Configuration for a replicated (cloned) voice.

 *
 * @property mimeType The mime type of the voice sample. Currently only `audio/wav` is supported,
 *   meaning 16-bit signed little-endian data at a 24kHz sampling rate.
 * @property voiceSampleAudio The sample of the custom voice.
 * @property consentAudio Recorded consent verifying ownership of the voice, in the same format.
 * @property voiceConsentSignature Signature of a previously verified consent audio.
