/**
 * Execution context passed to agent callbacks, model callbacks, and tools during an invocation.
 *
 * Provides read access to invocation metadata and session state, along with methods to record state
 * deltas, artifacts, and control-flow signals. Tool-specific operations such as
 * [requestConfirmation] require a [functionCallId], which is only populated during a tool call.
 *
 * [CallbackContext] and [com.google.adk.kt.tools.ToolContext] are thin subclasses kept for backward
 * compatibility. Prefer [Context] in new code.
 *
 * This class is `open` only so those two subclasses can exist as distinct JVM types that Java
 * callers can reference. Every member is `final` so subclasses only forward constructor arguments
 * without changing behavior.
 *
 * @property toolConfirmation The tool confirmation of the current tool call.

   * per-agent `toBuilder()` in `InvocationContext.java:270`). To break out of a [LoopAgent], set
   * `EventActions.escalate = true` instead.
   *
   * Mirrors Python ADK's `callback_context._invocation_context.end_invocation = True` and Java
   * ADK's `EventActions.setEndInvocation(true)` / `setEndOfAgent(true)`. Tools may equivalently set
   * `actions.endOfAgent = true`; both paths cause [LlmAgent.executeTurns] to exit after the current
