/**
 * How a node is retried when it raises. Every property is optional: null means "unset" and falls
 * back to the matching `DEFAULT_` constant when the retry is computed, except [exceptions], which
 * has no default. Unset is kept distinct from a set value rather than resolved at construction, so
 * a policy declared with field presence carries the same meaning here as where it was declared.
 *
 * @property maxAttempts Attempts including the first, so 0 or 1 means no retry.
 * @property initialDelay Delay before the first retry.
 * @property maxDelay Ceiling on any single delay.
 * @property backoffFactor Multiplier applied to the delay after each attempt.
 * @property jitter Randomness factor, not a duration: the delay is spread over `delay * (1 +/-
 *   jitter)`. Zero removes randomness.
 * @property exceptions Reported type names to retry on, matched exactly with no subclass match. The
 *   reported name is the failure's own simple name, or for a [NodeExecutionException] the wrapped
 *   failure's type name -- so list e.g. "RuntimeError", not "NodeExecutionException". Null retries
 *   any failure; an empty list retries none.
