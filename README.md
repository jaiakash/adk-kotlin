Agent Development Kit (ADK) is designed for developers seeking fine-grained
control and flexibility when building advanced AI agents that are tightly
integrated with services in Google Cloud. It allows you to define agent
behavior, orchestration, and tool use directly in code, enabling robust
debugging, versioning, and deployment anywhere – from your laptop to the cloud.

ADK for Kotlin now follows a stable release cycle, with regular releases
published to
[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.google.adk/google-adk-kotlin-core)
under [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Rich Tool Ecosystem**: Utilize pre-built tools, custom functions, OpenAPI
    specs, or integrate existing tools to give agents diverse capabilities, all
    for tight integration with the Google ecosystem.

-   **Code-First Development**: Define agent logic, tools, and orchestration
    directly in Kotlin for ultimate flexibility, testability, and versioning.

-   **Modular Multi-Agent Systems**: Design scalable applications by composing
    multiple specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.

-   **On-device & Cloud Agents on Android**: Run agents fully on-device with
    LiteRT-LM (with tool calling) or Gemini Nano via ML Kit, reach the cloud
    with Firebase AI, and compose on-device and cloud models into a single
    hybrid system. See
    [On-device and Cloud Agents on Android](#-on-device-and-cloud-agents-on-android).

## 📚 Documentation

For building, evaluating, and deploying agents by follow the Kotlin
documentation & samples:

*   **[Documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs)**
*   **[Samples](https://github.com/google/adk-samples)**

## 🏁 Feature Highlight

### Same Features & Familiar Interface As Python ADK:

```kotlin
import com.google.adk.kt.agents.LlmAgent
import com.google.adk.kt.agents.Instruction
import com.google.adk.kt.models.Gemini
import com.google.adk.kt.tools.GoogleSearchTool

val rootAgent = LlmAgent(
    name = "search_assistant",
    description = "An assistant that can search the web.",
    model = Gemini(name = "gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview"),
    instruction = Instruction("You are a helpful assistant. Answer user questions using Google Search when needed."),
    tools = listOf(GoogleSearchTool())
)
```

GenAI SDK based `Gemini` currently prevents usage of `API_KEY` and
`GoogleCredentials` on Android. Use Firebase AI instead.

### 📱 On-device and Cloud Agents on Android

ADK Kotlin agents run on Android either **fully on-device** — no API key and no
network at inference time, for offline, low-latency, or privacy-sensitive use —
or against the **cloud**. Every backend is a `Model` behind the same `LlmAgent`
API, so switching between them is a one-line change.

Backend     | Module                               | Inference | Tools
----------- | ------------------------------------ | --------- | ---------
LiteRT-LM   | `google-adk-kotlin-litertlm`         | On-device | ✅ Yes
ML Kit      | `google-adk-kotlin-mlkit-android`    | On-device | ❌ Not yet
Firebase AI | `google-adk-kotlin-firebase-android` | Cloud     | ✅ Yes

-   **LiteRT-LM** runs open models such as Gemma on-device through
    [LiteRT-LM](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM), Google's on-device
    inference framework, with **full tool / function calling** so an on-device
    agent can drive custom tools. It runs on both Android and the JVM (desktop).
    See [litertlm/README.md](litertlm/README.md).
-   **ML Kit (Gemini Nano)** runs the built-in Gemini Nano model through the ML
    Kit GenAI Prompt API. It is Android-only and published as a `-beta`
    pre-release; **tool calling is not supported yet** (`functionCall` /
    `functionResponse` parts are dropped), so use it for plain chat/generation
    for now.
-   **Firebase AI** reaches a cloud Gemini model through Firebase AI Logic — the
    recommended way to call Gemini from Android without embedding an API key —
    with full tool calling.

#### Hybrid on-device + cloud systems

Because on-device and cloud models are interchangeable `Model` implementations,
you can **compose them into a single multi-agent system**: an on-device agent
can handle offline, cheap, or privacy-sensitive turns and delegate harder tasks
to a cloud agent, all within one `LlmAgent` hierarchy. See
[Modular Multi-Agent Systems](#-key-features) for how agents are composed.

All three backends have runnable multi-turn chat examples in the
[`examples/android/`](examples/android) Compose app — **LiteRT-LM chat**, **ML
Kit chat**, and **Firebase AI**. See the
[Android examples README](examples/android/README.md) for how to build and run
the app, obtain the on-device models, and configure Firebase.

### Serving agents over HTTP

Add `com.google.adk:google-adk-kotlin-webserver` alongside the core artifact.
`AdkApiServer` then serves the agent runtime contract — app discovery, sessions,
artifacts, the run endpoints, health and version — without the development
surface, so it can be deployed headlessly:

```kotlin
import com.google.adk.kt.webserver.AdkApiServer
import com.google.adk.kt.webserver.AdkServerConfig

fun main() = AdkApiServer(AdkServerConfig.inMemory(rootAgent)).start(wait = true)
```

That listens on port 8080. `inMemory` keeps session and artifact state in the
process, so it suits a local run; build `AdkServerConfig` directly to serve
several agents or to persist state.

Run it however you run any other main class. With the Gradle `application`
plugin that is `mainClass = "com.example.MainKt"` — a top-level `main` in
`Main.kt` compiles to `MainKt`, not `Main` — and then `./gradlew run`.

The server binds loopback, because these endpoints are unauthenticated. Put your
own authentication in front of it before widening that:

```kotlin
import com.google.adk.kt.webserver.AdkApiServer
import com.google.adk.kt.webserver.AdkServerConfig

fun main() =
  AdkApiServer(AdkServerConfig.inMemory(rootAgent).copy(host = "0.0.0.0")).start(wait = true)
```

### Development UI

Same as the beloved Python Development UI.
A built-in development UI to help you test, evaluate, debug, and showcase your agent(s).

`AdkDevServer` takes the same config and adds the UI at
`http://localhost:8080/dev-ui`, together with the trace and agent-graph
endpoints it drives:

```kotlin
import com.google.adk.kt.webserver.AdkServerConfig
import com.google.adk.kt.webserver.dev.AdkDevServer

fun main() = AdkDevServer(AdkServerConfig.inMemory(rootAgent)).start(wait = true)
```

To leave the UI unmounted, set the `webUiEnabled` field on `AdkServerConfig`:

```kotlin
import com.google.adk.kt.webserver.AdkServerConfig
import com.google.adk.kt.webserver.dev.AdkDevServer

fun main() =
  AdkDevServer(AdkServerConfig.inMemory(rootAgent).copy(webUiEnabled = false)).start(wait = true)
```

Three things decide whether the UI is mounted. Highest wins:

1.  the `adk.web.ui.enabled` **system property**, when it is set to `true` or
    `false` in any casing — any other value is ignored with a warning
2.  the `webUiEnabled` **field on `AdkServerConfig`**, when it is not null
3.  the **server class**: `AdkApiServer` leaves the UI unmounted, `AdkDevServer`
    mounts it

So the system property is not an alternative to the field, it outranks it: a
stray `-Dadk.web.ui.enabled=true` in the launch environment re-mounts the UI even
though the config says `webUiEnabled = false`. It ranks highest so that a
deployment which cannot change code can still turn the UI off.

To try a few of this repository's own agents rather than your own:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=... ./gradlew :google-adk-kotlin-examples:runServer --args="--dev"
```
