/**
 * An [EventCompactor] that compacts events in a sliding window over invocations.
 *
 * Every `compactionInterval` new user-initiated invocations triggers a compaction over a window
 * spanning the new invocations plus `overlapSize` preceding invocations from the prior compaction
 * boundary. The overlap preserves context continuity across consecutive summaries.
 *
 * ## Safety net
 *
 * Before summarizing, the selected window is shrunk to its longest self-contained prefix so a
 * compaction never splits an open interaction. Both a function call and a human-in-the-loop
 * tool-confirmation request open an obligation keyed by the call ID, and a function response with
 * the same ID closes it. The window is cut back to the last point where no obligation is still
 * open, which guarantees:
 * - no function call is summarized without its response,
 * - no tool-confirmation request (`event.actions.requestedToolConfirmations`) without its resolving
 *   response.
 *
 * A summarizer failure skips the compaction instead of failing the caller, since the uncompacted
 * history is still usable.
