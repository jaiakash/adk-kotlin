/**
 * An [EventCompactor] that compacts events once the most recent prompt reaches a token threshold,
 * keeping a tail of recent events raw (tail retention).
 *
 * It is intended to run intra-invocation, before each model call: when the most recently observed
 * prompt token count reaches `tokenThreshold`, every event older than the last `eventRetentionSize`
 * events (since the previous compaction) is summarized into a single event, while the most recent
 * events are preserved raw to maintain continuity.
 *
 * ## Safety net
 *
 * The window never strands an open interaction: the window is shrunk to its
 * [longestSelfContainedPrefix]. A summarizer failure skips the compaction instead of failing the
 * caller, since the uncompacted history is still usable.
 *
 * @param config The compaction configuration; must have token-threshold fields set.
 * @param agentName The current agent name, used when estimating the prompt token count.
 * @param branch The current invocation branch, used when estimating the prompt token count.
