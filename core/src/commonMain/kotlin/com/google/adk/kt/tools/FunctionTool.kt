package com.google.adk.kt.tools

/**
 * Represents a compile-time generated tool that wraps a function annotated with
 * [com.google.adk.kt.annotations.Tool].
 *
 * The optional confirmation gate (set via the `requiresConfirmation` constructor parameter) makes
 * an invocation pause for human approval before the underlying function runs:
 * - On the first call the tool records a confirmation request via [ToolContext.requestConfirmation]
 *   and returns a placeholder error response without invoking the underlying function.
 * - Once the user supplies a [com.google.adk.kt.events.ToolConfirmation], the tool is re-executed:
 *   if the user confirmed it runs normally; otherwise it returns a rejection error response.
 *
 * The gate has two forms:
 * - Per-call predicate (the primary constructor): a `(args) -> Boolean` is invoked on every call
 *   with the function's `args` and decides whether to gate this invocation, e.g.
 *   `requiresConfirmation = { args -> (args["amount"] as Int) > 1000 }`. The default value `{ false
 *   }` disables the gate entirely.
 * - Boolean (the secondary constructor): a constant flag that gates either every invocation
 *   (`true`) or none (`false`). It is a thin wrapper that lifts the Boolean into a constant
 *   predicate `{ value }`.
